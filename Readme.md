# Patch DisPatch Web Scraping Tool (Node.js)

## Overview

The Patch DisPatch Web Scraping Tool is a Node.js-based program developed by [Zaions](https://www.zaions.com/bio), a software house, and its developer, [Ahsan Mahmood](https://zaions.com/ahsan). This tool is designed to automate web scraping tasks for the "Patch DisPatch" project.

## Features

- **Web Interaction**: It uses Puppeteer, a Node library, to control headless Chromium browsers, navigate to a website, enter extracted data, and submit forms.
- **Data Parsing**: The extracted data is parsed using JavaScript and the Puppeteer API.
- **Data Storage**: Extracted data can be saved in various formats, including CSV, Excel, or any desired format.
